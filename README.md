# Dissolved Aluminum

The Jupyter notebook called `Dissolved` calculates the pH of the minimum solubility of alum as a function of temperature. The app also determines whether *your* coagulation pH would exceed the suggested *safe limit* for dissolved aluminium according to Edzwald [(2020)](https://awwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/awwa.1499).
